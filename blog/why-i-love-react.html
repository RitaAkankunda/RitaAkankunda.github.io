            I love tech because of how fast the industry is growing. Every day brings new innovations, tools, and opportunities that weren't there before. It's an exciting space where you can constantly learn and adapt.

            When I joined my Computer Science course with zero knowledge about coding, I felt completely out of place. In the same class, there were kids who already had websites built during their vacations, some who started coding at an earlier age. It was intimidating, but I made a promise to myself to learn because I genuinely loved it.

            What I wanted was to work smartly, not just a traditional 9-to-5 job that drains you. I wanted remote work, freedom to pursue other interests outside my career, and the ability to do something I love without being exhausted. I found that space in tech – the flexibility, the creativity, and the potential for work-life balance.
