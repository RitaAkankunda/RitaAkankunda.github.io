          <p>
            As a Computer Science student, my journey into backend development began with curiosity about what happens behind the scenes of web applications. Frontend development was exciting, but I realized the real magic lies in the server-side logic that powers everything.

          <p>
            Starting with Node.js and Express, I learned how to build RESTful APIs that handle data efficiently. MongoDB became my go-to database for its flexibility in storing complex data structures. Through projects like Campus Hustle, I've applied these skills to create meaningful solutions for real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Backend development has taught me the importance of security, scalability, and clean architecture. I'm passionate about building systems that are not just functional, but also maintainable and secure.
